# Design Patterns - Filter Pattern

[Filter pattern or Criteria pattern](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/filter_pattern.htm) is a design pattern that enables developers to filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled way through logical operations. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines multiple criteria to obtain single criteria.
